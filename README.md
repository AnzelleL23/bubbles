#### Komodo (S)
- Beautiful and colorful coral in almost every site you go to.
- Reefs teeming with marine life in every corner. If you don’t see any fish, then you’re probably on a night dive.
- Not as many pelagics as one would hope for (there is the occasional reef shark and manta) but the vibrant reefs more than make up for it.
- Blue waters and amazing visibility virtually everywhere. 
- Amazing variety of diving: drifts, macro, shallow reefs, sandy bottom.
- The only place I’ve been to so far where I truly feel like I am straight out of a scene from ‘The Little Mermaid’, too difficult to describe the experience with words.

#### Nusa Penida (A):
- Impeccable visibility at crystal bay/ northern sites.
- Almost guaranteed manta sightings in the South + one of the few places in SEA to hunt for the mola mola.
- Corals are bountiful and healthy, especially in crystal bay/ sites close to Nusa Lembobgan.
- Only not S tier because apart from the aforementioned pelagics, there is surprisingly few fish, apart from a few spots.
- Decent amount of current which can be quite challenging but overall still manageable...though there are many horror stories online.

#### Verde Island (A):
- Very near Peurto Galera but decided to rank it separately since it is often marketed as a separate day trip destination
- This place is full of coral and marine life, some of the most outside of Komodo, maybe even comparable to some degree.
- Possible pelagic sightings around the pinnacle too.
- Unfortunately, the visibility is only decent, not fantastic. Then again, perhaps it is seasonal so this is subjected to change.
- The currents here are also extremely erratic and can be quite dangerous, probably the only place where I experienced pretty drastic up/ down currents.

#### Maldives Central Atolls (A):
- Difficult to rank every single atoll individually so I just grouped everything together as one.
- Pelagic paradise, black/ white tips on virtually every dive.
- Chance to get very very close to nurse sharks and mantas.
- Water was blue and visibility was generally great, though it was poorer at some of the channel diving sites if I remember correctly.
- Not ranked higher only because many places had bleached corals which is quite unfortunate. 
- Perfect for the ‘big stuff’ and drift diving.

#### Amed/ Tulamben (A):
- Grouped these two together since they are fairly similar in terms of marine life/ diving conditions.
- Fantastic blend of macro and coral diving. 
- The blue waters, clear visibility and fairly calm conditions make for very comfortable diving.
- Fire corals and shore entry kinda blows though.
- The legendary USAT liberty wreck with its abundance of critters living around/ inside is truly a sight to behold.
- Personal favourite in terms of ease of accessibility, cost and relaxation but only loses to those above due to having a lower density of critters and coral.

#### Sipadan (B):
- Probably my most controversial ranking in this list.
- Excellent place to see schools of bump head parrot fish and jackfish/ barracuda tornadoes.
- Water was blue and clear for the most part.
- Good reefs and decent marine life.
- However, I must admit that it is a little overrated in a sense that is it not the 'best diving site in the world'. Granted, this title was bestowed decades ago but many fish have clearly left the area since.
- The small size of Sipadan also means that you can explore the whole area in about 2 dives.
- I think the limited daily diving permits give an illusion of Sipadan being the crown jewel of diving.
- I feel that those in the A tier have a bit more to offer.
- I still recommend a trip here because it is indeed an extremely beautiful site, just that the hype is a little overblown and that the dives are not cheap at all.

#### Richelieu Rock (B):
- The only dive site in Thailand (that I’ve been to so far) where it genuinely feels like you’re diving in a fish tank.
- Thousands upon thousands of schooling fishes all around you with great coral patches around the pinnacle.
- Visibility was great for the most part but dropped a bit at certain locations
- My gripe is that this is a site with some currents, so to follow along the pinnacle without drifting away, a lot of kicking is involved, making the dive quite tiring.
- Ranked lower than Verde island and Sipadan since the aforementioned sites simply have much more coral.
- Possibly the best site in Thailand (that I have been to) but then again, Thailand diving is OK at best.

#### Peurto Galera (B):
- Huge variety of diving, all within 15 mins boat ride. 
- Incredibly healthy and colorful coral at the sites just east of Sabang beach.
- Good macro and marine life all around, healthy corals even at areas very close to civilisation.
- Gentle drifts at some sites with shallow coral for some awesome drift diving.
- Hampered by slightly greenish waters (visibility is still decent but I have a strong bias for blue waters) and absence of schooling fish.

#### Three Gili’s (B)
- A personal favourite in terms of a holistic dive holiday.
- There are sites with brilliant coral and pelagics (which comes with more currents), then there are those with gentle topography for macro hunting.
- Water temperature is perfect, visibility and colour are excellent.
- I would even claim to some extent that it feels like a 'discount Komodo', in terms of coral and water.
- The only reason why I cannot rank it higher than anything that came before, is because there is an entire passage (I can’t remember where exactly… perhaps on the west of Gili Air) covered in broken and dead coral from past dynamite fishing practices. It is like swimming in a coral graveyard which felt quite sad 
- Nevertheless, turtles galore, coral health (only considering those alive) and the water quality is enough for me to consider it as one of my top picks for a good diving holiday.
- Ultimately ranked Peurto Galera (PG) higher only because PG has more critters.

#### Anilao (B)
- The ease of accessibility to dive sites is a huge plus.
- The variability of scenery is quite astounding, from sandy bottom to coral gardens and even some coral walls.
- Great variety of nudibranch, which are also easy to spot.
- The dive sites across the straits at Maricaban island are really beautiful as well... visibility there is better too if I recall correctly. 
- I found it hard to compare a macro area against 'regular destinations' so I’m still not entire sure where it should belong.
- I think the easy diving and comfortable conditions made it quite enjoyable overall, landing it at the final spot in B tier.
